# vkp_Config
vkp_Config is a C++ easy to use library on order to read different variables from config text files and parse them automatically to standrad variable/objects types.

**Oct 2020**: vkp_Config is integrated as the *vkpConfigReader* in the `vkpLibs` repository at: https://github.com/terablade2001/vkpLibs . Future developments will take place at that repository.

**FYI**: You may be interested to check also the repository https://github.com/terablade2001/vp-cpp-template which is actually a "ready-to-develop-on" C++ template project incorporating different libraries like `vkpLibs`. It actually interconnects all utilities in a template project for quick starts on new development projects.
